<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sharna Brown. I am currently 22 years old. I am a keen learner and always want to learn as much as I can about things that interest me.</p>
<p>I'm an animal lover, avid reader and a little but of an introvert, to be honest.</p>
<p>I've been recognised in the workplace as a hard worker, intelligent, independent and efficient individual - I have even been nominated and made it to be a finalist in our national BPO awards in South Africa.</p>
<p>I absolutely love a challenge and will spend hours, days and weeks, if necessary, totally committed to the cause and figuring out the solution. Due to this, I've often been called a work-aholic but I don't mind!</p>
